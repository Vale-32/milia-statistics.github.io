    <h1>Itō Integration and Calculus: Concept and Didactical Simulations</h1>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Itō integration and calculus play a crucial role in the field of stochastic analysis,
        providing a powerful framework for modeling and analyzing random processes. This paper aims to provide a
        detailed and comprehensive overview of Itō integration and calculus, exploring their foundations, properties,
        and applications. </p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Itō calculus, named after the Japanese mathematician Kiyoshi Itō, is a branch of mathematics that extends
            traditional calculus to accommodate stochastic processes. Unlike classical calculus, which deals with
            deterministic functions and constants, Itō calculus focuses on functions that involve randomness, making it
            a fundamental tool in the study of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). This paper aims to provide a
            detailed exploration of Itō calculus, covering its historical background, basic concepts, key theorems, and applications.
        </p>

    <h2>2. Itō Calculus</h2>
        <p>Itō calculus primarily deals with stochastic processes, which are collections of random variables indexed by
            time. These processes capture the evolution of a system over time, taking into account the inherent
            uncertainty or randomness. Common examples include Brownian motion and Poisson processes.
            <br><br>
            The core of Itō calculus lies in defining and understanding stochastic integrals, which involve the
            integration of functions with respect to stochastic processes. Itō integration is characterized by its
            ability to handle the inherent randomness in the integrands and integrators. The Itō integral extends the
            classical Riemann-Stieltjes integral to accommodate stochastic integrators.
            <br><br>
            In this integral, both the integrands and integrators are stochastic processes. The Itō integral is defined as below:
            $$ \int{H(t) dW(t)} $$
            where \(H(t)\) is a stochastic process and \(dW(t)\) is the increment of a Wiener process (Brownian motion).
        </p>

    <h2>3. Itō Lemma</h2>
        <p>Itō's Lemma is a fundamental result in Itō calculus. This lemma plays a pivotal role in the study of stochastic
            processes and stochastic differential equations (SDEs). It provides a tool for differentiating functions
            involving stochastic processes, facilitating the analysis of dynamic systems under uncertainty. This paper
            aims to provide a detailed examination of Itō's Lemma, covering its formulation, interpretation, and applications.

            <i>Consider a deterministic function \( f(t, X(t)) \), where \( t \) represent time and \( X(t) \) is a
                stochastic process. The stochastic process \( X(t) \) can be described by an SDE of the form
                \( dX(t) = \mu(t) dt + \sigma(t) dW(t) \), where \( \mu(t) \) is the drift term \( \alpha(t) \) is the
                volatility term, and \( dW(t) \) is the differential increment of a Wiener process.

                Itō's Lemma states that the differential of the function \(f\) can be expressed as:

                $$ df(t, X(t)) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu(t) \frac{\partial f}{\partial X} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2(t) \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial X^2} \right) dt + \sigma(t) \frac{\partial f}{\partial X} dW(t) $$

                Here, \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}, \; \frac{\partial f}{\partial X} \), and \( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial X^2} \)
                denote the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to time and the stochastic process \(X(t)\).
            </i>
        </p>

    <h2>4. Simulation</h2>
        <p>Simulating Itō integration in Python involves generating paths of a stochastic process, typically using the
            Euler-Maruyama method. Below is an example Python code to simulate Itō integration for a simple geometric
            Brownian motion, which is a common model in finance.
            <br><br>
            This <a href="https://github.com/Vale-32/milia-statistics.github.io/blob/main/Th12_Simulation.py">code</a>
            simulates a geometric Brownian motion defined by the stochastic differential equation \( dX(t) = \mu X(t) dt + \sigma X(t) dW(t) \).
            The Euler-Maruyama method is used to discretize the stochastic differential equation and generate a simulated path of the process.

    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Itō calculus stands as a foundational tool in the analysis of stochastic processes, providing a rigorous
            framework for dealing with randomness in mathematical models. Its applications in finance, physics, and
            biology highlight its significance in understanding and modeling systems subject to uncertainty. As research
            in stochastic analysis continues, Itō calculus remains an essential and evolving field, contributing to
            advancements in various scientific disciplines.</p>

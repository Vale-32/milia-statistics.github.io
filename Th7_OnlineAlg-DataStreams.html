    <h1>Online Algorithms and Data Streams: Ideas and Code</h1>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Online algorithms and data streams are concepts in computer science and data
        processing that deal with situations where data arrives continuously, and the algorithm needs to process it
        on-the-fly without having access to the entire dataset at once. This is in contrast to offline algorithms, which
        assume that the entire input is available from the beginning.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Online Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Online algorithms are designed to make decisions or provide solutions without having complete information
            about the input data in advance. These algorithms are used in scenarios where the data arrives sequentially,
            and decisions must be made immediately without knowledge of future data. Online algorithms are often evaluated
            based on their competitive ratio, which measures how well the algorithm performs compared to an optimal
            offline algorithm that has complete knowledge of the input.
            <br><br>
            Examples of online algorithms include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Online Paging Algorithm</strong> In the paging problem, where a limited cache needs to store
                    pages of data, an online paging algorithm makes decisions about which pages to keep in the cache
                    without knowing future page requests. </li>
                <li><strong>Online Load Balancing</strong> In the context of distributing tasks across multiple servers,
                    online load balancing algorithms allocate incoming tasks to servers as they arrive, without knowing
                    the future workload.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <h2>2. Data Streams</h2>
        <p>Data streams refer to a continuous flow of data that is generated and consumed in real-time. Unlike
            traditional batch processing, where data is collected and processed in fixed-size chunks, data stream
            processing deals with data that is generated and processed on the fly, often in a single pass. Examples of
            data streams include social media feeds, network traffic, and sensor data.
            <br><br>
            Challenges and considerations in data stream processing include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limited Memory</strong> Data stream algorithms often have limited memory available for
                    processing. As the data is continuous, it may not be feasible to store the entire stream.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Sensitivity</strong> Processing must be done quickly, and decisions often need to be
                    made in near real-time to keep up with the continuous flow of data.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Nature</strong> Data streams are dynamic, and the characteristics of the data may
                    change over time. Algorithms must be adaptive to handle these changes.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <h2>3. Online Algorithms for Data Streams</h2>
        <p>Online algorithms are particularly relevant in the context of data streams. Some examples include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Count-Min Sketch</strong> A probabilistic data structure used for approximate counting of
                    events in a data stream.</li>
                <li><strong>Reservoir Sampling</strong> A technique for sampling a fixed-size subset of elements from an
                    incoming data stream, where the size of the stream is not known in advance.</li>
                <li><strong>Sliding Window Algorithms</strong> These algorithms maintain a window of the most recent
                    elements in the data stream and update their computations as new elements arrive, discarding older
                    elements.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <h2>4. Code</h2>
        <p>Let's consider a simple example of an online algorithm for computing the average of a stream of numbers.
            This algorithm maintains the running average as new numbers arrive. The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Vale-32/milia-statistics.github.io/blob/main/Th7_Simulation.py">code</a>
            demonstrates a basic Python implementation.
            <br><br>
            <img src="RunningAvgMCNumbers.png" alt="Running Average of Monte carlo Numbers.">
            <br><br>
            We simulated a stream of Monte Carlo numbers and computed the running average using an online algorithm. To
            generate Monte Carlo numbers (floats between 0 and 1) has been used the '<b>random</b>' module, while
            '<b>OnlineAverage</b>' class to compute the running average. '<b>The monte_carlo_stream</b>'
            is created using a list comprehension that generates 10 such random numbers.
        </p>

    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Online algorithms for data streams are crucial in applications such as real-time analytics, monitoring,
            and anomaly detection, where timely processing of incoming data is essential.</p>

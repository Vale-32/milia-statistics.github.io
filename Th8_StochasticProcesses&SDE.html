    <h1>Stochastic processes and SDE's</h1>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Stochastic processes and stochastic differential equations (SDEs) play a crucial role
        in modeling and analyzing systems with inherent uncertainty and randomness. This paper provides an overview on
        stochastic processes and on the stochastic differential equations. Subsequently, will be analyzed the link between
        these to finally deal with SDE solution. </p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Stochastic processes are mathematical models that describe the evolution of a system over time, taking into
            account random variations. These processes are essential for understanding and modeling phenomena in diverse
            fields, such as finance, biology, physics, and engineering. Stochastic differential equations, a natural
            extension of stochastic processes, provide a powerful tool for describing systems with both deterministic
            and stochastic components.</p>

    <h2>2. Stochastic Processes</h2>
        <p>A stochastic process is a mathematical concept that characterizes the evolution of a system over time in the
            presence of random fluctuations. At its core, a stochastic process is a collection of random variables,
            each associated with a specific point in time. These random variables represent the uncertain and dynamic
            nature of the system under consideration.
            <br><br>
            Stochastic processes can be categorized based on several key criteria. First, they may operate in either
            <b>discrete or continuous time</b>, depending on whether the system's evolution is observed at distinct time
            points or continuously over a time interval. Additionally, stochastic processes can be classified as
            <b>Markovian or non-Markovian</b>, depending on whether the future state of the system is solely determined
            by its present state or influenced by its entire past history (system's evolution is memoryless, and the
            future depends only on the current state, lack of historical dependence). Another classification criterion is
            <b>stationarity</b>, with processes categorized as stationary or non-stationary based on whether their
            statistical properties remain constant over time.
            <br><br>
            Among the most common stochastic processes we found <b>the Wiener process</b>, characterized by continuous paths
            and Brownian motion-like behavior; <b>the Poisson process</b>, modeling events occurring randomly in time;
            and the ubiquitous Brownian motion, a continuous-time stochastic process exhibiting random and continuous
            trajectories. </p>

    <h2>3. Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)</h2>
        <p> Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) offer a powerful framework for modeling dynamic systems subject to
            random fluctuations. The motivation for employing SDEs lies in their ability to capture the inherent
            uncertainty observed in real-world phenomena. Unlike deterministic models, SDEs acknowledge the presence of
            randomness, making them particularly well-suited for describing complex systems influenced by unpredictable
            factors.
            <br><br>
            The relationship between SDEs and stochastic processes is foundational to understanding their utility.
            An SDE is essentially an equation that involves both deterministic and stochastic components, and it describes
            how a system evolves over time in the presence of random forces. By linking SDEs with stochastic processes,
            one can leverage the broader understanding of how randomness operates within a system and gain insights into
            the statistical properties of the modeled processes.</p>

    <h2>4. Deriving SDEs from Stochastic Processes</h2>
        <p>Consider a continuous-time stochastic process, and let \(X_t\) represent the state of the system at time \(t\).
            The infinitesimal change in \(X_t\) can be expressed as the sum of a deterministic part and a stochastic part.
            The latter is typically modeled using a Wiener process, also known as Brownian motion. Mathematically,
            this leads to the basic form of an SDE:
            $$ dX_t = a(X_t, t)dt + b(X_t,t)dW_t  $$
            where:
            <ul>
                <li>\(a(X_t, t)\) is called <b>Drift term</b> and represents the deterministic part of the change in the process.</li>
                <li>\(b(X_t,t)\) is called <b>Diffusion term</b> and represents the random part of the change, scaled by the Wiener process.</li>
                <li>\(dW_t\) is the differential of a Wiener process (Brownian motion), representing the
                random component.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <h2>5. SDE Solution</h2>
        <p>Itô's lemma stands as a cornerstone in the analysis of SDEs. Named after the Japanese mathematician Kiyosi Itô,
            this lemma provides a crucial tool for expressing the differential of a function of a stochastic process.
            It plays a pivotal role in the calculus of stochastic processes, enabling the derivation of differential
            equations involving stochastic terms. Itô's lemma is indispensable for transforming equations involving
            stochastic processes into a more analytically tractable form, facilitating the solution and analysis of
            complex systems.
            $$ dX_t = a(X_t, t)dt + b(X_t,t)dW_t \Longrightarrow df = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial X_t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial X_t^2}\right)dt + \sigma \frac{\partial f}{\partial X_t} dW_t $$
            for any differentiable function \(f(X_t, t)\).

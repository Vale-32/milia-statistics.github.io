        <h2>1. Introduction:</h2>
        <p>The Gambler's Ruin Problem, also known as the Random Walk Problem, dates back to the 16th century and has since been a subject of significant mathematical interest. The problem is framed around a simple betting scenario where a gambler with limited resources engages in a series of fair bets against an opponent. The objective is to understand the probability of the gambler losing their entire bankroll or, conversely, reaching a predetermined fortune.</p>

        <h2>2. Mathematical Formulation:</h2>
        <p>Consider two players, A and B, engaged in a series of fair bets. Player A starts with a capital of \(\alpha\) dollars, and player B with \(b\) dollars. At each step, A wins a dollar from B with probability \(p\), and loses a dollar to B with probability \(q = 1 - p\). The game continues until A's capital reaches \(0\) or \(N\), where \(N\) is a fixed threshold.</p>

        <h2>3. Historical Development:</h2>
        <p>The Gambler's Ruin Problem has a rich history, with notable contributions from mathematicians such as Blaise Pascal and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Pascal, in his correspondence with Pierre de Fermat, laid the groundwork for probability theory, providing an early framework for solving the problem. Laplace extended these ideas, formulating the probability mass function for the Gambler's Ruin Problem.</p>

    <h1>Statistical Distributions: Continuous, Discrete, Properties and simulations</h1>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A probability distribution is a mathematical function that provides the
        probabilities of the occurrence of various possible outcomes in an experiment. Statistical distributions
        play a crucial role in analyzing and interpreting data across various fields, providing insights into the
        patterns and characteristics of datasets. Two fundamental types of distributions are continuous and discrete
        distributions.</p>

    <h2>1. Discrete distributions</h2>
    <p>Discrete distributions deal with countable outcomes and are often associated with variables that take on
        distinct, separate values. Common examples of discrete distributions include the binomial distribution and the
        Poisson distribution. The binomial distribution, for instance, is used to model the number of successes in a
        fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. Discrete distributions are characterized by probability mass
        functions, which assign probabilities to individual points in the dataset.</p>

    <h2>2. Continuous distributions</h2>
        <p>In contrast, continuous distributions deal with uncountable outcomes and are associated with variables that
            can take on any value within a given range. The normal distribution and the exponential distribution are
            examples of continuous distributions. The normal distribution, often referred to as the bell curve, is
            prevalent in various natural phenomena and is characterized by a probability density function. Unlike
            discrete distributions, continuous distributions assign probabilities to intervals rather than specific
            points.</p>

    <h2>3. Properties</h2>
        <p><strong>Discrete distribution</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Discrete Random Variables</b> The random variable \(X\) takes on distinct, separate values.</li>
                <li><b>Probability Mass Function (PMF)</b> Describes the probability of each possible outcome.
                    \(P(X = x)\) gives the probability of the random variable \(X\) taking the value \(x\).
                <li><b>Probability Space</b> The sum of all probabilities for all possible outcomes equals 1,
                    \(\sum {P(X = x)} = 1\).
                <li><b>Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)</b> \( F(x) = P(X \leq x) \) gives the probability that
                    the random variable \(X\) is less than or equal to \(x\).
                <li><b>Expectation</b> Often denoted as \(E(X)\), is a measure that represents the average or mean value
                    of a random variable. The expectation of a random variable is calculated by taking the sum of the
                    products of each possible value of the variable and its corresponding probability. For a discrete
                    random variable \(X\) with probability mass function \(P(X)\), the expectation is given by:
                    \( E(X) = \sum_{i}{x_i * P(X = x_i)} \)</li>
                <li><b>Variance</b> Measure of the dispersion or spread of a set of data. Variance provides valuable
                    information about the degree of variability or spread in a dataset. A higher variance indicates that
                    the data points are more dispersed from the mean, while a lower variance suggests that the data
                    points are closer to the mean. Variance is a key component in the calculation of standard deviation,
                    another important measure of the spread of data. For a sample of data, the sample variance \(s^2\) is
                    given by: \(s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{(X_i - \hat{X})^2} \), where \(n\) is the number of
                    data points, \(X_i\) represents each individual data point and \(\hat{X}\) is the sample mean.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Continuous Random Variables</b> The random variable \(X\) can take any value within a range
                    \( [a;b] \).</li>
                <li><b>Probability Density Function (PDF)</b> Describes the likelihood of a random variable taking on a
                    particular value in a continuous range. \( P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b{f(x) dx}\), where \(f(x)\)
                    is the PDF.
                <li><b>Probability Space</b> The area under the entire PDF curve is equal to 1,
                \(\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{f(x) dx} = 1 \)
                <li><b>Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)</b> \(F(x) = P(X \leq x)\) gives the probability that the
                random variable \(X\) is less than or equal to \(x\).
                <li><b>Expectation</b> For a continuous random variable \(X\) with probability density function \(f(x)\),
                the expectation is calculated as an integral over the entire range of possible values:
                \(E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{x * f(x) dx}\)</li>
                <li><b>Variance</b> Population variance \(\sigma^2\) is calculated using a similar formula, but with
                    \(n\) replaced by \(N\), where \(N\) is the total number of elements in the population, and \(\mu\)
                    is the population mean: \(\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}{(X_i - \mu)^2} \)</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>4. Practical Applications</h2>
    <p><strong>Real-World Example of Discrete Distribution</strong><br>
        Consider a scenario where you are interested in modeling the number of defective items produced by a
        manufacturing process in a day. The random variable here is the count of defective items, and it takes on
        discrete values (0, 1, 2, 3, and so on). The probability mass function of a binomial distribution can be used
        to model this situation. The binomial distribution provides the probabilities of obtaining a specific number of
        successes (defective items) in a fixed number of independent trials (production runs). <br>
        For instance, let's say the probability of producing a defective item on any given trial is \(p=0.05\), and you
        are interested in the number of defective items in 10 trials. The binomial distribution can be used to calculate
        the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, ..., 10 defective items in a day.

    <br><br><strong>Real-World Example of Continuous Distribution</strong><br>
        Imagine you are studying the heights of individuals in a population. The random variable here is height, and it
        can take on any value within a range. In this case, a normal distribution (also known as a Gaussian distribution)
        can be a suitable model. The normal distribution is characterized by a bell-shaped curve and is commonly used to
        describe natural phenomena like human height. <br>
        Suppose the mean height in a population is 170 cm, and the standard deviation is 10 cm. You can use the
        probability density function of the normal distribution to calculate the probability of finding individuals
        with heights within certain ranges. For example, you can find the probability that a randomly selected individual
        has a height between 160 cm and 180 cm.
    </p>
    
    <h2>5. Challenges and Considerations</h2>
        <p>While discrete and continuous distributions offer powerful tools for statistical analysis, it is essential
            to consider the limitations and assumptions associated with each. Discrete distributions may oversimplify
            real-world scenarios where outcomes are not perfectly distinct, while continuous distributions may assume a
            level of precision that may not be realistic in certain contexts. Careful consideration of the underlying
            assumptions is crucial to avoid misinterpretation of results.</p>

    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, statistical distributions, whether discrete or continuous, form the foundation of statistical
            analysis. The choice between these distributions depends on the nature of the data and the characteristics
            of the variables being studied. Discrete distributions are suitable for countable outcomes, while continuous
            distributions are more appropriate for variables with a range of possible values. A thorough understanding
            of the characteristics, applications, and limitations of both types of distributions is essential for
            researchers and practitioners in making informed decisions in data analysis and modeling.</p>

  <h1>The Gaussian Distribution: Meaning, Derivations, and Simulations</h1>

  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Gaussian distribution, also known as the normal distribution, plays a pivotal role in various
    fields, ranging from statistics and probability theory to physics, finance, and machine learning. This paper aims
    to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Gaussian distribution, exploring its meaning, mathematical
    derivations, and simulations. We delve into the origins of the Gaussian distribution, its key properties, and the
    central limit theorem, which underpins its ubiquity in diverse domains. Additionally, we present derivations of the
    probability density function and cumulative distribution function, shedding light on the fundamental concepts that
    define this distribution. To enhance understanding, we complement the theoretical aspects with practical
    simulations that illustrate the Gaussian distribution in action.</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Gaussian distribution, named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, is a continuous probability distribution that is
    symmetric, bell-shaped, and characterized by its mean and standard deviation. This distribution is often encountered
    in natural phenomena, making it a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. Its ubiquity is attributed
    to the central limit theorem, which states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically
    distributed random variables tends to follow a Gaussian distribution.</p>

    <h3>1.1 Gauss's life and historical context</h3>
      <p>Carl Friedrich Gauss (30 April 1777, Brunswick -  23 Febrary 1885, Gottinga) was a prodigious mathematician,
        astronomer, and physicist. Gauss's mathematical abilities, were evident since his young age. In his teens, he
        made significant contributions to number theory. At the age of 19, Gauss independently discovered the method of
        least squares, but his work in number theory culminated in his doctoral thesis, "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,"
        published in 1801, which remains a foundational text in the statistical field. Gauss's career continued to
        flourish, he also contributed to physics, particularly in the understanding of magnetism and the Earth's magnetic field.
        <br><br>
        Gauss's legacy endures not only through his theorems and formulas but also in the broader application of his
        mathematical methods across various scientific disciplines. His impact on mathematics, astronomy, and physics
        solidifies his status as one of the most influential scientists in history. His influence extended beyond his
        research; he mentored numerous students who went on to become prominent mathematicians and scientists.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Gauss's contributions</h3>
      <p>Gauss's significance in the development of mathematics is underscored by the broad range of fields in which his
        ideas continue to shape research and applications. His methods and theorems remain fundamental in both pure and
        applied mathematics, ensuring his enduring legacy in the scientific community. The significance of his work lies
        in several key areas:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Number Theory - </strong>Gauss's "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae" laid the groundwork for modern number
            theory. It provided a systematic treatment of properties of integers and introduced concepts such as modular
            arithmetic and quadratic reciprocity.</li>
          <li><strong>Geometry and Differential Geometry - </strong>Gauss made significant contributions to geometry,
            particularly in the study of curved surfaces. His work on intrinsic geometry and the development of Gaussian
            curvature laid the foundation for differential geometry.</li>
          <li><strong>Statistics - </strong>Gauss developed the <b>method of least squares</b>, a statistical technique
            for estimating the parameters of a mathematical model by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences
            between observed and calculated values.But also <b>the normal distribution</b>, often referred to as the Gaussian
            distribution, is a fundamental concept in statistics that emerged from Gauss's work.</li>
          <li><strong>Celestial Mechanics - </strong>Gauss made significant contributions to celestial mechanics by
            formulating methods to predict the orbits of celestial bodies. His insights and calculations contributed to
            the understanding of the motion of planets and asteroids. The method of Gaussian gravitational constant, used
            in orbit determination and satellite tracking, is still employed today.</li>
          <li><strong>Physics and Magnetism - </strong>Gauss conducted pioneering work in the field of magnetism,
            contributing to the understanding of the Earth's magnetic field. His magnetic observations and formulations
            advanced the study of geomagnetism. The unit of magnetic flux density, the gauss, is named in honor of his
            contributions in this field.</li>
          <li><strong>Mathematical Methods in Physics - </strong>Gauss's mathematical methods, particularly those related
            to differential equations and mathematical analysis, influenced theoretical physics. His ideas played a role
            in the development of electromagnetism and laid the groundwork for later advances in the field.</li>
          <li><strong>Computational Mathematics - </strong>auss made significant contributions to the development of
            numerical methods and algorithms. His contributions to interpolation, approximation, and the fast Fourier
            transform have had a lasting impact on computational mathematics.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

  <h3>Gauss's contributions to the development of statistical methods</h3>
    <p>Gauss's work in statistics had a profound impact on the field, providing a systematic and rigorous approach to
      estimating parameters in mathematical models. Here are key aspects of Gauss's contributions to statistical methods:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Method of Least Squares - </strong>The method aims to find the best-fitting curve to a set of
          observations by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed and calculated values.
          This technique is widely used in regression analysis, where it helps determine the coefficients of a mathematical
          model that best fits a given set of data points. The method of least squares became a cornerstone of statistical inference.</li>
        <li><strong>Gaussian Distribution - </strong>He demonstrated that the distribution of errors in subsequential
          observations follows a bell-shaped curve, with most errors clustering around the mean. The Gaussian distribution
          is crucial in statistics and probability theory. It serves as the foundation for many statistical methods,
          including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and the central limit theorem.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Deviation - </strong> Also know as "probable error", represents a measure of the spread of
          a set of data points around the mean.</li>
        <li><strong>Probability Theory - </strong>Gauss made significant contributions to the development of probability
          theory. He worked on the development of the method of moments and provided insights into the statistical
          properties of data. His work laid the groundwork for the application of probability in statistical analysis,
          providing a theoretical basis for understanding uncertainties and variability in data.</li>
      </ol>
  Gauss's work in statistics not only provided practical methods for handling observational errors but also laid the
  theoretical foundation for statistical inference. The method of least squares and the Gaussian distribution, in
  particular, remain fundamental tools in modern statistics, playing a crucial role in data analysis and scientific research.
    </p>

  <h2>2. The Gaussian Distribution</h2>
    <p>The Gaussian Distribution,  also known as the normal distribution or bell curve, is a probability distribution
      that is symmetric and characterized by its bell-shaped curve. It represents the probability distribution of a
      continuous random variable which shape is completely determined by two parameters: the mean \(mu\) and the standard
      deviation \(\sigma\).
      <br><br>
      The Probability Density Function (PDF) of the Gaussian Distribution is given by the formula:
      $$ f(x; \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} * e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} $$
      <img src="NormalDistribution.png" alt="PDF Gauss Distribution variation." width="1200" height="600" class="center">
      <br><br>
      The figure shows the Gauss Distribution PDF variation at \(mu\) and \(\sigma\) change. From the figure it is easy
      to see how the mean \(\mu\) locates the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation \(\sigma\)
      controls the spread or dispersion.
    </p>

      <h3>2.2 Properties</h3>
        <p>All properties can be derived from the study of its function analytic:
            <ul>
              <li>Symmetrical with respect to the x-axis, infact $$ (x - \mu)^2 = [-(x - \mu)^2] = (x - \mu)^2 $$ </li>
              <li>It has a relative (and absolute) maximum at the point \( x = \mu \):
              $$ f'(x) = - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} * e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} * \frac{(x-\mu)}{\sigma} = 0 \Rightarrow x-\mu = 0 \Rightarrow x = \mu $$</li>
              <li>The maximum hold:
              $$ f(\mu) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} * e^{-\frac{(\mu -\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} * e^0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} $$</li>
              <li>The area subtended by the curve is about 1:
              $$ \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} * e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} dx} $$
              $$ consider \; \mu = 1 \; and \; \sigma = 1: \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} * e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} dx} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} * \sqrt{2 \pi} =1 $$</li>
              <li>Important areas underneath the Normal curve identified in minimum mean-square distances from the mean:
                <br>- 0.6826 of the area lies between \( (x - \sigma ) \)  and \( (x + \sigma ) \)
                <br>- 0.9544 of the area lies between \( (x - 2\sigma ) \)  and \( (x + 2\sigma ) \)
                <br>- 0.9973 of the area lies between \( (x - 3\sigma ) \)  and \( (x + 3\sigma ) \)
                <img src="GaussStdDev.png" alt="PDF Gauss statdard deviation" width="1200" height="600" class="center"></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

      <h3>2.3 The Standardized Normal Distribution</h3>
        <p>The standardized normal distribution, also known as the Z-distribution or standard normal distribution, is a
          special case of the normal distribution. It has a mean \( \mu = 0) \) and standard deviation \( \sigma = 1 \).
          The probability density function (PDF) of the standardized normal distribution is denoted by \( \Phi(z) \)
          where \( z \) is the tandardized variable.
          <br><br>
          The PDF of the standardized normal distribution is given by:
          $$ \Phi(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{- \frac{z^2}{2}} $$
          The standardized normal distribution is important in statistics because it allows for the transformation of
          any normal distribution into a standard form. This transformation is achieved by subtracting the mean and
          dividing by the standard deviation.
          <br>
          For a random variable \( X \) following a normal distribution with mean \( \mu \) and standard deviation \( \sigma \),
          the standardized variable \( Z \) is calculated as:
          $$ Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} $$
          The use of the standardized normal distribution simplifies statistical calculations and comparisons, as it
          provides a common scale for normal distributions with different means and standard deviations. Tables of the
          standardized normal distribution, often referred to as Z-tables, are widely used in statistical inference for
          looking up probabilities associated with specific Z-scores.
          <br><br>
          The <b>z-score</b> indicates by how many standard deviations the random variable \(x\) deviates from the mean.
          It gives the relative position of \(x\) with respect to the center of the distribution. E.g.: a z-score of 2
          means that between the mean and the variable \(x\) there are 2 standard deviations.
          <br><br>
          In other words, if we have a normal distribution the probabilities corresponding to the areas subtended by the
          normal curve between two extremes \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) can be calculated by transforming the distribution into
          the standard normal distribution. These probabilities are reported in a table.
          <img src="Z-Score-Table.jpg" alt="PDF Gauss statdard deviation" width="600" height="1200" class="center">
          <br><br>
          This avoids the need for complex integral calculations to find the probabilities of a variable \(X\) taking values
          within certain intervals. It also allows immediate comparison between different distributions.

  <h2>3. The Gaussian Distribution into the real world</h2>
    <p>In real-world scenarios, many phenomena exhibit a Gaussian-like behavior, making it a suitable model for various
      applications.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality Control </strong>In manufacturing and quality control, the Gaussian distribution is often
          used to model variations in product specifications. Deviations from normality may indicate issues in the
          production process.</li>
        <li><strong>Biological Sciences </strong>Many biological measurements, such as height, weight, and blood pressure,
          tend to follow a Gaussian distribution. This makes the Gaussian distribution a common choice for modeling and
          analyzing biological data.</li>
        <li><strong>Physics and Engineering </strong> Errors in measurements, often exhibit a Gaussian distribution.
          This distribution simplifies the analysis of uncertainties and errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Image and Signal Processing </strong>Gaussian distributions are frequently used in image and signal
          processing to model noise. Filtering techniques based on Gaussian distributions are employed to enhance and
          denoise images and signals.</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning and Data Science </strong>Gaussian distributions are used in various machine
          learning algorithms, especially in clustering and classification. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are a popular
          method for modeling complex data distributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Studies </strong>Environmental data, such as pollution levels or weather phenomena,
          may be modeled using Gaussian distributions, allowing for the analysis of natural variability.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <h2>4. Simulations: Students Performance</h2>
    <p>For the simulation part, I made use of a dataset found on the net <i>StudentsPerfomance.csv</i> that collects the
      results obtained by high school United States students on end-of-year exams. The dataset is made up the following
      columns: <i>gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, math score,
        reading score and writing score.</i>
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1 - Know the dataset</h3>
      <p>First, to familiarize with the dataset and its structure, I visualized the first few rows and then had a
        statistical overview returned.

        From the dataset we learn that:
        <ul>
          <li>there are 1000 scores for math, reading and writing;</li>
          <li>all means are very close to each other - between 66 and 68.05;</li>
          <li>all standard deviations are also close - between 14.6 and 15.19;</li>
          <li>while there is a minimum score of 0 for math, for writing minimum is much higher - 10, and for reading myet higher - 17.00;</li>
          <li>for all three disciplines the highest score of 100 was achieved at least by one student.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <h3>Step 2 - Normality Check</h3>
      <p>As second step, I simply build three histograms, one for every discipline, and visually check whether data
        seems normally distributed.
        <img src="NormalityCheck.png" alt="PDF Gauss statdard deviation" width="1200" height="600" class="center">
        The three histograms look like Gaussian distibution! Let us go further and try to fit a bell curve over a histogram.
      </p>

    <h3>Step 3 - Fit a bell curve</h3>
      <p>Now as we know that the data looks Gaussian, we can try to fit a bell curve to prove it. For that, we will first
        calculate mean and standard deviation, then generate a normally distributed array and finally plot the array curve.

  <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the Gaussian distribution is a cornerstone in probability theory and statistics, playing a crucial
      role in modeling diverse phenomena. This paper has explored the meaning of the Gaussian distribution, presented
      derivations of its probability density and cumulative distribution functions, and highlighted the significance of
      the central limit theorem. Simulations have been introduced as a valuable tool for enhancing understanding and
      visualizing the Gaussian distribution in practice. As we continue to encounter the Gaussian distribution in various
      disciplines, a solid grasp of its foundations and applications remains essential for researchers, analysts, and
      practitioners alike.</p>

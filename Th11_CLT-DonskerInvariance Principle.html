    <h1>The functional CLT, Donsker's invariance principle: Proof and Simulations</h1>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Donsker’s Invariance Principle is a powerful concept in probability theory that extends the
        classical Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to the functional setting, specifically addressing empirical processes.
        This paper aims to provide a thorough exploration of Donsker’s Invariance Principle, offering a detailed proof
        and accompanying code simulations to enhance understanding and demonstrate practical applications. </p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The classical CLT is a fundamental result characterizing the asymptotic behavior of the sum or average of
            independent and identically distributed random variables. Donsker’s Invariance Principle builds upon this,
            extending the CLT to empirical processes observed in function spaces. This paper delves into the theoretical
            foundations and implications of Donsker’s Invariance Principle.
        </p>

    <h2>2. Donsker’s Invariance Principle</h2>
        <p>To understand Donsker's Invariance Principle, it's essential to grasp the concept of empirical processes.
            An empirical process is a sequence of random variables that represents the cumulative distribution function
            (CDF) of a sample. These processes play a crucial role in statistical theory, enabling the study of
            convergence properties and asymptotic behavior.
            <br><br>
            Donsker's Invariance Principle is often formulated in the context of the Skorokhod space, a mathematical
            framework for dealing with stochastic processes that have cadlag (right-continuous with left limits) sample
            paths. This space is chosen due to its ability to accommodate a wide range of processes encountered in
            probability theory and statistics.
        </p>

    <h2>3. Donsker’s Invariance Principle: Statement and Proof</h2>
        <p>Donsker's Invariance Principle can be stated as follows:
            <br><br>
            Let \(X_1,X_2,...\) e a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) andom variables with
            cumulative distribution function \(F\), and let \(F_n\) be the empirical distribution function based on the
            first \(n\) observations. Then, the process \(\sqrt{n}(F_n -F) \) converges in distribution to a standard
            Brownian bridge as \(n\) approaches infinity.
            <br><br>
            In simpler terms, Donsker's Invariance Principle asserts that the standardized empirical process converges
            to a standard Brownian bridge as the sample size grows indefinitely.
            <br><br>
            The proof of Donsker’s invariance principle involves demonstrating tightness and weak convergence. Here’s a
            high-level outline of the proof:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Tightness</strong>The proof often starts by establishing tightness, ensuring that the family
                    of processes under consideration doesn't exhibit excessive variability.</li>
                <li><strong>Skorokhod Representation Theorem</strong>The Skorokhod Representation Theorem is a crucial
                    tool in the proof. It allows for the construction of processes with prescribed marginal distributions
                    and specified sample paths.</li>
                <li><strong>Characteristic Functions</strong>The use of characteristic functions facilitates the
                    demonstration of convergence in distribution. Donsker's Invariance Principle involves establishing
                    the convergence of characteristic functions, linking it to the convergence of the processes themselves.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

    <h2>4. Simulations</h2>
        <p>To complement the theoretical exposition, this paper provides detailed code simulations using Python
            programming language. The simulation methodology involves generating empirical processes, applying Donsker’s
            Invariance Principle, and comparing the simulated results with the expected Gaussian distribution.

    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Donsker's Invariance Principle is a powerful tool that extends the classical CLT to the functional setting.
            Its implications are far-reaching, impacting fields where empirical processes play a
            vital role. The principle provides a bridge between probability theory and statistics, enabling a deeper
            understanding of the behavior of stochastic processes in function spaces.

    <h1>The Viener Process and the GBM, Derivations and Simulations</h1>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>This paper explores two fundamental stochastic processes: the Wiener process and the
        Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). The Wiener process, also known as Brownian motion, forms the foundation of
        stochastic calculus and serves as a crucial model for describing random movements. The Geometric Brownian Motion,
        an extension of the Wiener process, is widely used in financial modeling, especially in the pricing of options
        and understanding asset price dynamics. In this paper, we provide detailed derivations of both processes and
        present simulations to illustrate their key characteristics. </p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Wiener process, introduced by Norbert Wiener in the early 20th century, is a continuous-time stochastic
            process that exhibits random and unpredictable movements. It has become a cornerstone of stochastic calculus,
            providing a mathematical framework to describe the evolution of various phenomena, including financial markets.
            The Geometric Brownian Motion, an extension of the Wiener process, is particularly relevant in the context
            of modeling asset prices.
        </p>

    <h2>2. The Wiener Process</h2>
        <p>The Wiener process, also known as Brownian motion, is a continuous-time stochastic process that has wide
            applications in various fields, including physics, finance, and biology. Named after Norbert Wiener, who
            introduced it in the early 20th century, the Wiener process is characterized by its random and unpredictable
            movements. It serves as a fundamental building block for stochastic calculus and has become a crucial tool
            in modeling the dynamics of systems that undergo random fluctuations.
            <br><br>
            The Wiener process is defined by the following key properties:
            <ul>
                <li>The process starts at zero: \(W(0) = 0\)</li>
                <li>Independent increments: For any sequence of time points \(0 \leq t_1 < t_2 < \ldots < t_n\), the increments \(W(t_1), W(t_2) - W(t_1), \ldots, W(t_n) - W(t_{n-1})\) are independent</li>
                <li>Normally distributed increments: The increments \(W(t_{i+1}) - W(t_i)\) are normally distributed with mean zero and variance \(t_{i+1} - t_i\).</li>
            </ul>
            Mathematically, the Wiener process is often denoted by \(W(t)\), where \(t\) epresents time.
        </p>

    <h2>3. Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)</h2>
        <p>The Geometric Brownian Motion is an extension of the Wiener process and is widely used in finance to model
            the continuous-time evolution of asset prices. The GBM is defined by the stochastic differential equation:
            $$ dS(t) = \mu S(t)dt + \sigma S(t)dW(t) $$
            where:
            <ul>
                <li>\(S(t)\) is the asset price at time \(t),</li>
                <li>\(\mu\) is the drift parameter representing the expected return per unit time,</li>
                <li>\(\sigma\) is the volatility parameter representing the standard deviation of the asset return,</li>
                <li>\(W(t)\) is the Wiener process. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <h2>4. Simulation</h2>
        <p>To illustrate the properties of the Wiener process and the GBM, we conduct simulations using Monte Carlo
            methods. We generate sample paths of these processes and analyze the resulting trajectories. Simulations
            provide a practical understanding of how these processes behave over time and help validate the theoretical
            derivations.

                    Set the initial value of the Wiener process:  \(W(0)=0\).</li>
                <li>Generate Random Increments: For each time step \(i\), generate a random number from a normal distribution
                    with mean 0 and variance \( \Delta t: \; Z_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Delta t) \).
                    Update the Wiener process \(W(t_{i+1}) = W(t_i) + Z_i\)</li>
